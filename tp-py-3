#### About Project 
Aim is to create a currency converter to help us convert a sum of money from one currency to another.
Currency exchange rates are constantly changing which is why we have decided against the idea of storing all the exchanges rates in our code are these would not remain up-to-date.
Instead we will retrieve up-to-date currency exchange rates by making calls to an API that provides the current rates.
